  \begin{itemize}
  \item Try to reduce the influence of noise in the original data and compression/decompression artifacts in the lossy data
    on FTK distance by using something like Gaussian filtering
  \item If the above helps, speed up FTK
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use MPI to call FTK in parallel 4 times
    \item Accelerate FTK on GPU?
    \item Use MPI version of FTK once Hanqi releases it
    \end{itemize}
  \item Try newer accelerated version of MGARD
  \item Benchmark Kokkos and original version of Gray-Scott on Theta
  \item Unify how compression/decompression timing is done for all the compression algorithms
  \item Visualize $256^3$ with ParaView after all the changes since the previous set of movies was generated
  \item Resolve LLVM compiling issues on Theta
  \item Debug OpenMP GPU offloading version of Gray-Scott?
  \item Put the pipeline into Spack? Singularity container?
  \end{itemize}
